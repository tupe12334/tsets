### Phase 3: Codebase Exploration

1. **Identify Entry Points**:
   - Main application entry: index.ts, main.ts, app.ts, server.ts, cli.ts
   - Package entry: Check "main" and "exports" in package.json
   - Script commands: Review npm/pnpm scripts

2. **Explore Directory Structure**:
   - Identify main source directories (src/, lib/, app/)
   - Understand organization patterns (feature-based, layer-based)
   - Locate tests (\*.spec.ts files next to logic, or test/ directories)
   - Find documentation (docs/, documentation/)

3. **Analyze Code Patterns**:
   - Identify architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, modular)
   - Check coding conventions (naming, file organization)
   - Review common utilities and shared code
   - Understand import/export patterns

### Phase 4: Technology Stack Understanding

1. **Core Technologies**:
   - Programming language(s) and version
   - Primary framework(s)
   - Database(s) if applicable
   - Key libraries and their purposes

2. **Development Tools**:
   - Package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, pip, cargo)
   - Build tools and bundlers
   - Testing frameworks
   - Linting and formatting tools

3. **Architecture & Patterns**:
   - Application architecture (monolith, microservices, serverless)
   - Design patterns in use
   - State management approach (if frontend)
   - API patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

### Phase 5: Current State Analysis

1. **Recent Activity**:
   - Review last 5-10 commits to understand recent work
   - Check git status for any uncommitted changes
   - Look for work-in-progress features or branches

3. **Grep**: For searching code patterns and keywords
4. **Bash**: For running analysis commands
5. **Task**: For complex exploration that needs an Explore agent

### Recommended Exploration Order

1. Start broad: README, package.json, root-level configs
2. Review steering: .kiro/steering/ documents if they exist
3. Explore structure: Directory layout and organization
4. Dive into code: Entry points, core modules, utilities
5. Understand workflows: Scripts, tests, build processes
6. Check current state: Git history, active work, specs

## Important Notes

- **Be Thorough**: This is a learning session, take time to explore deeply
- **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, note it in your summary
- **Take Notes**: Document your findings as you learn
- **Identify Gaps**: Note any missing documentation or unclear areas
- **Be Systematic**: Follow the phases in order for complete coverage
- **Use Context**: Connect the dots between different parts of the project

## Success Criteria

You should be able to answer:

- ✓ What does this project do?
- ✓ How is it architected?
- ✓ What technologies does it use?
- ✓ How do I set it up and run it?
