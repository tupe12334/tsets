# Comprehensive Feature Validation

Deep validation and testing of feature: **$1**

## Context Discovery

**IMPORTANT**: This command works with ANY project structure. No specific folder layout required.

### Phase 0: Documentation Discovery

Automatically search for feature documentation in common locations:

**Documentation Patterns to Search**:
- `README*.md` - Feature descriptions in main README
- `docs/**/*.md` - Documentation folders
- `specifications/**/*.md` or `specs/**/*.md` - Specification documents
- `design/**/*.md` - Design documents
- `.kiro/specs/$1/**/*.md` - Kiro specs (if using Kiro workflow)
- `*.md` files in project root
- Code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc in source files

**Search Strategy**:
1. Use Task tool with Explore agent to find all documentation mentioning "$1"
2. Search for files containing feature name in title or content
3. Identify requirements, design docs, API docs, user guides
4. Extract any available context about the feature

**Fallback Strategy**:
If no documentation found:
- Proceed with code-only analysis
- Infer feature scope from code implementation
- Document the lack of documentation as a finding

### Project Context Discovery

Search for project-level documentation (if available):
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
- Tech stack: `docs/tech.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `.kiro/steering/tech.md`
- Product context: `docs/product.md`, `.kiro/steering/product.md`
- Contributing guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Adaptive Approach**: Use whatever documentation exists, don't require specific structure.

## Task: Ultra-Comprehensive Feature Validation

### Phase 1: Documentation Analysis

**Documentation Discovery & Review**:
Use Task tool with Explore agent to:
- Find ALL documentation related to "$1" feature
- Search across entire codebase for mentions of the feature
- Extract expected behavior from any available docs
- Identify acceptance criteria (if documented)
- Note success metrics (if defined)

**Documentation Quality Assessment**:
- Code comments alignment with implementation
- API documentation accuracy (if applicable)
- User-facing documentation completeness
- Technical debt documentation
- **Missing documentation identification** (what should be documented but isn't)

### Phase 2: Codebase Deep Dive

**Implementation Discovery**:
Use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore (very thorough mode) to:
- Identify ALL files implementing the feature
- Map complete code flow and execution paths
- Trace data flow through the system
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Check test coverage for feature components
- Find related configuration files

**Code Quality Analysis**:
- Architecture alignment with project patterns
- Code consistency with existing codebase conventions
- Error handling and edge case coverage
- Security considerations (input validation, auth, XSS, injection, etc.)
- Performance considerations (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks)
- Type safety (TypeScript: proper types, avoid `any` overuse)
- Code duplication and reusability

**Technical Debt Assessment**:
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments related to the feature
- Workarounds or temporary solutions
- Known limitations documented or discovered
- Areas requiring refactoring
- Dependencies on deprecated libraries or patterns

### Phase 3: Behavioral & Requirements Analysis

**Expected Behavior Extraction**:
From any available documentation:
- Core functionality requirements
- User stories or use cases
- Business rules and constraints
- Integration requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

**Implementation Verification**:
- Map each requirement (if documented) to implementation
- Identify implemented features not documented
- Find documented features not implemented
- Check acceptance criteria fulfillment

**Gap Analysis**:
- Missing functionality vs documentation
- Extra functionality not documented
- Inconsistencies between docs and code
- Incomplete implementations

### Phase 4: Interactive Testing with Playwright

**Test Planning**:
- Identify user-facing components requiring UI testing
- Map user flows based on requirements (or inferred from code)
- Identify edge cases and error scenarios
- Plan API endpoint testing (if applicable)

**Automated Testing Execution**:

**For UI Features**:
1. Launch browser with Playwright MCP
2. Navigate to feature location
3. Test primary user flows
4. Test form validation and error messages
5. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Verify responsive behavior (desktop, mobile)
7. Check accessibility basics (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
8. Capture screenshots showing feature states (save to `/tmp/`)
9. Monitor console for errors and warnings
10. Test error recovery and user feedback

**For API Features**:
1. Test successful request/response flows
2. Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
3. Test error conditions (4xx, 5xx responses)
4. Test input validation and sanitization
5. Test authentication/authorization
6. Test rate limiting (if applicable)
7. Verify response data structure and types
8. Check error message quality

**For CLI/Backend Features**:
1. Test command-line interface (if applicable)
2. Test with valid inputs
3. Test with invalid inputs
4. Test error handling
5. Verify output format and content

**Test Result Documentation**:
- All tests executed with pass/fail outcomes
- Screenshots of UI states (stored in `/tmp/`, NOT repo)
- API response examples (stored in `/tmp/`, NOT repo)
- Performance metrics observed (response times, load times)
- Console errors, warnings, or network failures detected
- Accessibility issues found

### Phase 5: Bug Analysis & Issue Identification

**Comprehensive Bug Detection**:
- Functional bugs (feature doesn't work as expected)
- UI/UX issues (poor user experience, confusing interactions)
- Performance problems (slow responses, memory leaks)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth bypass, data exposure)
- Accessibility issues (missing labels, keyboard nav, contrast)
- Edge case failures (boundary values, null/undefined, empty states)
- Error handling gaps (uncaught exceptions, poor error messages)
- Integration issues (API failures, database errors, third-party service problems)

**Bug Classification**:
- **Critical**: Feature broken, data loss/corruption, security vulnerability, system crash
- **High**: Major functionality impaired, poor UX, security concern, performance severely degraded
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, edge case failures, moderate performance impact
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconsistencies, small UX improvements

**Root Cause Analysis**:
For each bug identified:
- Exact reproduction steps (numbered list)
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Code location causing the issue (file:line references)
- Root cause analysis (technical explanation of WHY)
- Impact assessment (what users/systems are affected)
- Suggested fix with technical approach

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Report Generation

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT create files in the repository. Output the report directly to the user.

Generate a detailed validation report with:

2. **Deep & Thorough**: Examine every aspect - code, docs, behavior, security
3. **Evidence-Based**: Provide file:line references for all findings
4. **Objective Assessment**: Use clear metrics and criteria
5. **Actionable Output**: Every issue needs a concrete fix plan
6. **No Junk Files**: Report directly to user, NEVER commit reports
7. **Test Everything**: Actually run code and test user flows with Playwright
8. **Think Like User**: Test from user perspective, not just developer view
9. **Security First**: Always check for vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, auth)
10. **Ultra-Thorough**: Use deep reasoning for complex analysis

## Execution Instructions

1. **Use Task tool for discovery**: Launch Explore agent with "very thorough" mode
2. **Find all context**: Search entire codebase for feature documentation
3. **Adapt to structure**: Work with whatever exists, no rigid requirements
4. **Trace implementation**: Map feature to actual code
5. **Test comprehensively**: Use Playwright MCP for real interactive testing
6. **Think deeply**: Apply thorough analysis to identify root causes
