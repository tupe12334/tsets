# Implement and Validate Feature

Complete end-to-end implementation and validation for feature: **$1**

Executes ALL pending tasks using TDD methodology, then runs comprehensive validation with testing and bug analysis.

## Overview

This command combines:

1. **Implementation Phase**: Execute all pending spec tasks using TDD (`/kiro:spec-impl`)
2. **Validation Phase**: Comprehensive feature validation with testing (`/tupe:validate-feature`)

## Prerequisites Check

Validate that the specification is ready for implementation:

**Required Files**:

- `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json` - Spec metadata
- `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md` - Feature requirements
- `.kiro/specs/$1/design.md` - Technical design
- `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` - Implementation tasks

**Approval Validation**:

- Check `spec.json` for approval status
- Ensure tasks phase is complete: `phase: "tasks-generated"` or later
- If approvals missing: Stop with error message:

  ```
  ❌ Specification not ready for implementation

  Run these commands first:
  1. /kiro:spec-requirements $1
  2. /kiro:spec-design $1
  3. /kiro:spec-tasks $1

  Or use -y flag to auto-approve: /kiro:spec-tasks $1 -y
  ```

---

## Phase 1: Context Loading

Load complete project context for implementation:

### Core Steering Documents

- @.kiro/steering/structure.md - File organization, naming, code patterns
- @.kiro/steering/tech.md - Technology stack, frameworks, libraries
- @.kiro/steering/product.md - Business context, product vision

### Custom Steering Documents

- Load ALL additional `*.md` files in `.kiro/steering/` directory (excluding core files above)
- Examples: `api.md`, `testing.md`, `security.md`, etc.

### Specification Documents for $1

- @.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json - Metadata and approval tracking
- @.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md - EARS-format requirements
- @.kiro/specs/$1/design.md - Technical design document
- @.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md - Implementation tasks with checkboxes

---

## Phase 2: TDD Implementation (All Tasks)

Execute **ALL pending tasks** (unchecked `- [ ]` items) using strict Test-Driven Development methodology.

### Task Identification

Parse `tasks.md` to identify:

- Total tasks: [count all checkbox items]
- Completed tasks: [count `- [x]` items]
- Pending tasks: [count `- [ ]` items]
- Task list: [extract all pending task numbers and descriptions]

**Output Example**:

```
📋 Task Analysis for feature: $1
   Total tasks: 15
   ✅ Completed: 3
   ⏳ Pending: 12

   Pending tasks to implement:
   - [ ] 1.2 Implement authentication service
   - [ ] 2. Build user management system
   - [ ] 2.1 Create user CRUD operations
   - [ ] 2.2 Add user validation logic
   ... (list all pending tasks)
```

### TDD Cycle for Each Task

For each pending task in sequential order:

#### 1. RED Phase - Write Failing Tests First

**Before any implementation code**:

- Analyze task requirements from tasks.md details
- Reference requirements and design documents for expected behavior
- Write comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Error conditions and validation
  - Integration points with existing code
- Run tests to confirm they fail (no implementation yet)

**Test File Naming**:

- Follow project conventions from `structure.md`
- Common pattern: `*.spec.ts` files next to implementation (DDD approach)
- Place tests next to the logic they test for better discoverability

#### 2. GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation

**Write just enough code to pass the tests**:

- Implement ONLY what the current task requires
- Follow design document specifications strictly
- Use project patterns from `structure.md`
- Follow tech stack conventions from `tech.md`
- Aim for simplest solution that passes tests
- No premature optimization
- No extra features beyond task scope

**Implementation Guidelines**:

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Clear, descriptive naming
- Type safety (TypeScript: proper types, avoid `any`)
- Input validation and error handling
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

#### 3. REFACTOR Phase - Clean and Improve

**After tests pass, improve code quality**:

- Remove duplication
- Improve naming and clarity
- Extract reusable components
- Optimize data structures
- Add helpful comments for complex logic
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Maintain test coverage

**Refactoring Checklist**:

- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] No code smells detected
- [ ] Follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests still pass after refactoring

#### 4. VERIFY Phase - Quality Assurance

**Before marking task complete**:

- Run ALL project tests (not just new ones)
  ```bash
  npm test || pnpm test || yarn test
  ```
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality
- Run linter if configured
  ```bash
  npm run lint || pnpm lint || yarn lint
  ```
- Run type checker (TypeScript)
  ```bash
  tsc --noEmit || npm run type-check
  ```
- Check test coverage (if configured)
- Manual smoke test of the feature

**Quality Gates** (MUST PASS before continuing):

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Test coverage maintained or improved
- ✅ No console errors or warnings

**If any gate fails**:

- Fix issues immediately
- Re-run verification
- Do NOT proceed to next task until all gates pass

#### 5. MARK COMPLETE Phase - Update Task Status

**After successful verification**:

- Update tasks.md: change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed task
- Example:
  ```markdown
  - [x] 2.1 Create user CRUD operations
  ```
- Commit the implementation with descriptive message:

  ```bash
  git add [relevant files only]
  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
  feat($1): implement task X.Y - [task description]

  [Brief explanation of what was implemented]
  - Added [feature/component]
  - Implemented [functionality]
  - Tests: [test coverage added]

  Task: X.Y from .kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md

  )"
  ```

### Task Execution Loop

**Repeat TDD cycle for ALL pending tasks**:

```
For task in pending_tasks:
  ├─ 1. RED: Write failing tests
  ├─ 2. GREEN: Implement to pass tests
  ├─ 3. REFACTOR: Clean and improve
  ├─ 4. VERIFY: Run all quality gates
  └─ 5. MARK COMPLETE: Update tasks.md & commit

Next task...
```

### Progress Tracking

**After each task completion, output progress**:

```
✅ Task 2.1 completed: Create user CRUD operations
   Progress: 4/15 tasks complete (27%)
   Remaining: 11 tasks

   Next task: 2.2 Add user validation logic
```

### Integration Tasks

**Pay special attention to integration tasks**:

- These wire together previously implemented components
- Test end-to-end flows
- Verify components work together correctly
- Check for integration bugs
- Validate complete feature functionality

### Implementation Complete

**When all tasks are checked**:

```
🎉 Implementation Phase Complete!

   Feature: $1
   Total tasks completed: 15/15

   All tests passing ✅
   All quality gates passed ✅
   All tasks committed ✅

   Moving to Validation Phase...
```

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation

After implementation completes, run **ultra-thorough validation** using the same methodology as `/tupe:validate-feature`.

### Validation Overview

Execute six-phase comprehensive validation:

1. Documentation Discovery & Analysis
2. Codebase Deep Dive
3. Behavioral & Requirements Analysis
4. Interactive Testing with Playwright
5. Bug Analysis & Issue Identification
6. Report Generation

---

### Phase 3.1: Documentation Discovery

**Adaptive Documentation Search** - works with ANY project structure:

**Search Locations** (use Task tool with Explore agent):

- `README*.md` - Feature descriptions
- `docs/**/*.md` - Documentation folders
- `.kiro/specs/$1/**/*.md` - Kiro specification (our source of truth)
- `specifications/**/*.md` or `specs/**/*.md` - Other specs
- `design/**/*.md` - Design documents
- `*.md` files in project root
- Code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc

**Search Strategy**:

1. Use Task tool (Explore agent, "very thorough" mode) to find all docs mentioning "$1"
2. Extract expected behavior from documentation
3. Identify requirements, acceptance criteria, success metrics
4. Note any project-level architecture/tech/product docs

**Fallback**: If minimal documentation, use `.kiro/specs/$1/` as primary source and infer from code.

**Documentation Quality Assessment**:

- Completeness: Are all aspects documented?
- Accuracy: Does documentation match implementation?
- Clarity: Is documentation understandable?
- Maintainability: Is documentation up-to-date?
- Gaps: What's missing that should be documented?

---

### Phase 3.2: Codebase Deep Dive

**Implementation Discovery** (use Task tool with Explore agent, "very thorough"):

**Find and analyze**:

- ALL files implementing the feature
- Complete code flow and execution paths
- Data flow through the system
- Integration points and dependencies
- Test coverage for feature components
- Configuration files related to feature

**Code Quality Analysis**:

**Architecture**:

- Alignment with project patterns from `structure.md`
- Modularity and separation of concerns
- Component boundaries and responsibilities
- Dependency management
- Integration approach

**Code Consistency**:

- Follows codebase conventions
- Consistent naming patterns
- Consistent error handling approach
- Consistent file organization
- Matches existing code style

**Error Handling**:

- Input validation present and thorough
- Edge cases covered (null, undefined, empty, boundary values)
- Error messages clear and actionable
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Proper exception handling

**Security Assessment**:

- Input sanitization (prevent injection attacks)
- Authentication and authorization checks
- XSS prevention (sanitize user input in UI)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- CSRF protection (if applicable)
- Sensitive data handling (no secrets in code/logs)
- Rate limiting (if applicable for APIs)

**Performance Analysis**:

- Algorithm efficiency (no O(n²) where O(n) possible)
- Database query optimization (no N+1 queries)
- Caching strategies (appropriate memoization)
- Memory management (no leaks, proper cleanup)
- Bundle size impact (for frontend)
- Response time measurements

**Type Safety** (TypeScript projects):

- Proper type definitions (interfaces, types)
- Avoid excessive `any` usage
- Type guards for runtime safety
- Consistent type patterns
- Generic usage where appropriate

**Code Duplication**:

- DRY principle adherence
- Reusable components extracted
- Shared utilities utilized
- No copy-paste code

**Technical Debt Identification**:

- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments (with file:line references)
- Workarounds or temporary solutions
- Known limitations
- Areas needing refactoring
- Dependencies on deprecated libraries

---

### Phase 3.3: Behavioral & Requirements Analysis

**Expected Behavior Extraction**:

From `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md` and other documentation:

- Core functionality requirements
- User stories and use cases
- Business rules and constraints
- Integration requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Acceptance criteria

**Implementation Verification**:

**Requirements Traceability**:
For each requirement in `requirements.md`:

```
REQ-X.X: [Requirement description from requirements.md]
Status: ✅ Implemented / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing
Implementation: [file:line references]
Tests: [test file references covering this requirement]
Notes: [Any deviations, concerns, or limitations]
```

**Gap Analysis**:

- Missing functionality: Requirements not implemented
- Extra functionality: Implemented features not in requirements (scope creep?)
- Inconsistencies: Docs say X, code does Y
- Incomplete implementations: Partial functionality
- Test coverage gaps: Requirements without tests

---

### Phase 3.4: Interactive Testing with Playwright

**Test Planning**:

- Identify all user-facing surfaces (UI, API, CLI)
- Map user flows from requirements
- List edge cases and error scenarios
- Define acceptance test cases

**Automated Testing Execution**:

#### For UI Features (Web Application)

**Browser Testing with Playwright MCP**:

1. **Setup**:

   ```

**🟢 Low** (Nice to fix):

- Cosmetic issues
- Minor inconsistencies
- Small UX improvements
- Non-critical code quality issues

### Root Cause Analysis

For **each bug found**, provide detailed analysis:

```markdown
🔴 BUG-001: User session expires without warning, losing form data

**Severity**: High

**Category**: UX Issue / Data Loss Risk

**Location**: src/auth/session-manager.ts:45, src/components/UserForm.tsx:120

**Reproduction Steps**:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the user profile form
3. Fill out the form with data (don't submit)
4. Wait 15 minutes (session timeout)
5. Click "Save" button
6. Observe: Session expired error, form data lost

**Expected Behavior**:

- User should receive warning before session expires (at 13-14 min mark)
- Form data should be auto-saved to localStorage as fallback
- On session expiry, user should be redirected to login with return URL
- After re-login, user should return to form with data restored

**Actual Behavior**:

- No warning given before session expires
- Form submission fails with generic error: "Authentication required"
- User is not redirected to login page automatically
- All form data is lost (user must re-enter everything)

**Root Cause**:
The session manager (session-manager.ts:45) checks auth status only on API calls, not proactively. The UserForm component does not implement auto-save or session monitoring. When the API call fails due to expired token, the error handling (UserForm.tsx:120) only shows a generic error and doesn't preserve form state.

Technical details:

- Session timeout: 15 minutes (set in auth config)
- No client-side session monitoring or warning system
- No localStorage backup for form data
- Error handler catches 401 but doesn't trigger re-auth flow

**Impact**:

- High user frustration (data loss)
- Affects all forms in the application with long fill times
- Poor user experience, especially for users who are interrupted
- Lost productivity for users who must re-enter data
- Potential for users to abandon the application

**Suggested Fix**:

1. **Implement Session Warning** (Priority 1):
   - Add session monitoring in session-manager.ts
   - Show modal warning at 13-minute mark: "Your session will expire in 2 minutes. Save your work or click here to extend."
   - Provide "Extend Session" button that calls a keep-alive endpoint
   - Implementation: Use setInterval to check session expiry time

2. **Add Form Auto-Save** (Priority 1):
   - Implement auto-save to localStorage in UserForm
   - Save form state every 30 seconds or on input change (debounced)
   - Key format: `autosave_userform_${userId}_${formId}`
   - Restore from localStorage on component mount
   - Clear localStorage on successful submission

3. **Improve Error Handling** (Priority 2):
   - On 401 error, save form state to sessionStorage
   - Redirect to login with return URL
   - After successful login, redirect back and restore form state
   - Show message: "Your session expired. Please log in again to continue."

4. **Add Session Extension API** (Priority 2):
   - Create GET /api/auth/extend-session endpoint
   - Extends session by another 15 minutes
   - Call on user activity (mouse move, keyboard input) with throttling

**Fix Effort Estimate**: 6-8 hours

- Session warning: 2-3 hours
- Form auto-save: 2-3 hours
- Error handling improvements: 1-2 hours
- Testing: 1 hour

**Testing Approach**:

1. Mock short session timeout (2 minutes for testing)
2. Verify warning shows at expected time
3. Test "Extend Session" button works
4. Verify form auto-save by filling form, refreshing page
5. Test session expiry during form submission
6. Verify redirect to login and return flow
7. Test across all forms in application

**Risks**:

- localStorage quota could be exceeded (mitigate: limit autosave data size)
- Session extension could be exploited (mitigate: limit extensions per session)
- Multiple tabs could conflict (mitigate: use unique keys per tab)
```

**Repeat this detailed analysis for EVERY bug found.**

**Current Risk Level**: [Low / Medium / High]

**Blocking Issues**:
[List any issues preventing production deployment, or "✅ No blocking issues"]

**Final Recommendation**:

[Provide detailed, actionable recommendation. Examples:]

**Example 1 (Production Ready)**:

```
✅ PRODUCTION READY

This feature is well-implemented and thoroughly tested. All core functionality works as designed, with good code quality and comprehensive test coverage (87%). No critical or high-priority bugs were found during validation.

Minor issues identified (2 medium, 1 low) can be addressed post-deployment without user impact. The implementation follows project patterns, has proper error handling, and passes security and accessibility checks.

**Confidence Level**: High
**Recommendation**: Deploy to production
**Post-Deployment**: Monitor [key metrics], address medium issues in next sprint
```

**Example 2 (Needs Fixes)**:

```
⚠️ NEEDS FIXES BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

The feature is functionally complete but has 2 high-priority bugs that should be fixed before production:
1. BUG-003: Session timeout causes data loss (High - 6 hours to fix)
2. BUG-007: Missing input validation allows invalid data (High - 3 hours to fix)

These issues would impact user experience and data integrity. All other aspects (performance, security, accessibility) are acceptable.

**Estimated Fix Time**: 9 hours + 2 hours testing = ~11 hours total
**Confidence Level**: Medium (after fixes)
**Recommendation**: Fix high-priority bugs, then deploy
**Next Steps**: Implement fixes from "Immediate Actions Required" section above
```

**Example 3 (Requires Rework)**:

```
❌ REQUIRES REWORK BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

The feature has 3 critical bugs that indicate fundamental issues requiring significant rework:
1. BUG-001: Complete feature failure on edge case (Critical)
2. BUG-002: SQL injection vulnerability (Critical)
3. BUG-005: Data corruption on concurrent access (Critical)

Additionally, test coverage is only 34%, security concerns exist, and performance is unacceptable (>5s response times). The implementation deviates significantly from project patterns and would be difficult to maintain.

**Estimated Rework Time**: 3-5 days
**Confidence Level**: Low
**Recommendation**: Do not deploy; significant rework needed
**Next Steps**:
1. Fix all critical bugs (highest priority)
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Address security vulnerabilities
4. Performance optimization
5. Re-validate after fixes
```
